This is a simple app that was created so that someone could get a free month of code school courtesy of New Relic.
Thanks New Relic! Anyway, it was originally supposed to completely non-functional, until I decided to use the
Meteocons icon set (http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/) as the background. I had to make it relevant and thus
came the 'check the weather' part. I used World Wide Weather's api for that.
